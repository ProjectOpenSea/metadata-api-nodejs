# Sample Metadata API for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) <!-- omit in toc -->

Use this repo to make an API for serving metadata about your tokens ([ERC-721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) or [ERC-1155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1155.md)) to marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io) and other third parties.

Metadata for each token can include an image, animation, attributes, scalar properties, boost properties, and more!

## Getting Started

### Requirements
You need node.js (8.11.* or later) and npm installed. If you want to do a Heroku deployment, download and install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and run `heroku login` locally.

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/metadata-api-nodejs`
2. Change directories `cd metadata-api-nodejs`
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `heroku create your-metadata-api`. If the name `your-metadata-api` was already taken you'd get the error ` â–¸    Name your-metadata-api is already taken`. Try different names until one works. This also adds heroku to your `git remote` so you can push to it.
5. Use your favorite code editor to save the Heroku URL you picked into `src/constants.js` as the `HOST` variable (e.g. `https://your-metadata-api.herokuapp.com`). This is the root URL for the tokens on your contract.
6. Run `git add src/constants.js` and `git commit`
7. Run `git push heroku master`
8. Check your api endpoint by going to `your-metadata-api.herokuapp.com/api/token/1`
## Minting Tokens

Here's a [tutorial on setting up a mintable NFT contract](https://docs.opensea.io/docs). Alternatively, you can have your buyers mint the tokens for you (and pay the gas to do that) at purchase-time, using the [OpenSea Crowdsale Tutorial](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/opensea-initial-item-sale-tutorial).

Now that you a contract and a token URI for each of your tokens, there's a nice [mint.js script](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/opensea-creatures/blob/master/scripts/mint.js) that you can run locally to mint them on a testnet like Rinkeby and on mainnet Ethereum.

If you want more control over the minting process, call [_setTokenURI](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/1fd993bc01890bf6bd974aaf3d709bdf0a79b9bf/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Metadata.sol#L68) on your NFT's contract using the URL pattern above, either directly if you exposed that method for the contract `owner`, or by minting new tokens using [mintWithTokenURI](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721MetadataMintable.sol#L19).

## Selling Tokens

If you're signed into MetaMask as the owner of your contract, you can click the "SELL" button on any asset to sell it immediately on OpenSea, using Dutch (declining price), English (to the highest bidder), and fixed-price auctions.

### Selling in Bulk

You can also use the OpenSea.js SDK to create sell orders. You can [create sell orders in bulk](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/opensea-js#running-crowdsales) if you followed the [Crowdsale Tutorial](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/opensea-initial-item-sale-tutorial) above.
